## Introduction

The goal of this course project is to clean and transform a raw dataset into a tidy data set.
It uses the <i>Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set</i> from
the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/">UC Irvine Machine
Learning Repository</a>, a popular repository for machine learning
datasets. 

Here are the specific requirements:


1. Merge the train and test datasets

2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4. Label the data set with descriptive variable names. 

5. Get the average for each variable grouped by activity and subject.

## Included Files 

* <b>run_analysis.R</b> This is the R script that implements the steps to generate the tidy data.

* <b>CodeBook.md</b> Describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.
