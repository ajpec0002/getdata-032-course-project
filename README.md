## Introduction

The goal of this course project is to clean and transform a raw dataset into a tidy data set.
It uses the <i>Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set</i> from
the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/">UC Irvine Machine
Learning Repository</a>, a popular repository for machine learning
datasets. 

Here are the specific requirements:


* Merge the train and test datasets

* Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

* Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

* Label the data set with descriptive variable names. 

* Get the average for each variable grouped by activity and subject.

## Included Files 

* <b>run_analysis.R</b> This is the R script that implements the steps to generate the tidy data.

* <b>CodeBook.md</b> Describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.
